////// Write a method that combines two strings, by taking one character from the first string, then
one from the second string and so on. Once one string has no characters left it should carry on
with the other string. For example, for strings "day" and "time" should give the result
"dtaiyme"/////



#here is a simple method function that will allow both characters to one by one put next to eachother to form a new word
#here are the paremeters that are being used  and will be the place holders for the different wrds will try
def Letsmixthemup(One, Two):
#this is a if statement here tha
    if not (One and Two):
        return One + Two
#this statement here states that both one and twos first letters 0 will be added together with 1: which has been split apart and that will contine
    return One[0] + Two[0] + Letsmixthemup(One[1:], Two[1:])
