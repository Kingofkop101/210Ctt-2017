/////Write a recursive version of linear search on an array of integers. What is the time complexity
of the algorithm? Use the BigO notation to express it.//


#here is my function for my list and it also has a couple of permateres which is the list i am going to search and then also target value im looking 4.
def MyLinearSearch(TheArray, TargetValue):
#next im going to have the program search through the whole array for said value etc.
#also this function will print out all of the elements
#the for loop is also exculsive and inclusive which means that
    for M in range ( len( TheArray)):
#here if the array is equal to the target value that im testing then the array will be returned
        if TheArray[M]==TargetValue:
        ##here the function is stopped
         return M
#here when the for loop has been completely gone through and the if loop iside is not entered then it is not found and therefore i need tp return -1


    return -1
