////Use binary search in implementing a guessing game. One thinks of a number between 1 and
20000, the program attempts to guess the number and feedback is given whether my number
is higher or lower. The program then makes a new guess and so on until it guesses the right
number.

#here i have created a function in that my game wil be stored with
def Theguessinggame():
    min, max, pythonsguess, Theplayers_answer = 0,2000,None,None
    
    #this is the bit where i make the game more personal and then allow the players to
    print ("Hello there my name is Mr.Python the super computer!!!!!Lets play game. What number are you thinking of??")
#here i will now input the name of the player so that we have a name to go on aswell there guess 
    nameplayer=input("But first what is you name mannnnn!!!!")
    print("thats a really wicked name!!"+str(nameplayer)+", okay now that is settled could you please pick a interger betweennnn" +str(min)+ "and" + str(max))

#here we next use the while loopso that rpeats the queston untilo answer is correct
#this wil keep cutting the space in half and then guessing the middle of it.
    while (Theplayers_answer!="Correct"):
#the computers guess will be 0 plus 2000 divided by two as shown and then rounded to the next whole number
        pythonsguess = (min+max)//2
#here we are now getting feedback from the python game. str wil ake thenumber a string so it can be printed 
        Theplayers_answer=input("Calculating....Calculating....Calculating.....99% done. Found is your number...."+str(pythonsguess)+"   Toooooo high? if so type in(High), Toooo Low? if so type in(Low), or am i right? if so type in(Correct)??")
#if the geuss is equal to high then we set the new minum to last thing we guesssed
        if Theplayers_answer=="High":

#here the same is done except the new maximum if the is the players guess
