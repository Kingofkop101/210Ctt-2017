///////Check if a 3 digit number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number of three digits is an
integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example,
371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371. Input: a number, such as 371
Output: “Yes” if the number is an Armstrong number, “No” if the number is not an Armstrong 


#armstrong numbers are numbers that when multipled to the power of how mucg digit the whole number has is then the exazct same as the original number.
#an exampleof this would be 371 for exampoe as when 3**3,7**3,1**3 are all added to gether they make 371 so this an armstrong number. 
#to do this i have created a function below and then from that i have used one permaeter called Armstrong where the interger will be stored etc.
def ThisisMyArmstrong(Armstrong):
#here is where the lengt of the interger will be stored
    length=len(Armstrong)
#here is where the parameter which is as a string will be stored as and converted into a interger
    n=int(Armstrong)
#here is when the calculations are done and added up the total and overall umber wil be stored with here
    Armtotal=0
#this is where the actual number is stored within 
    WhNumber=n

#as long as the number is greater then 0 this while loop while run continuously calculating the whether its a amstorng or ot.
    while n>0:
#this calculation will find the cube of each of the digits and the sum of it.
#wit the number inutted into the n varaible and stored as a interger.
#within this calculation the length of the armstrong will be used in order to help come up wit what its being cubbed by.
        A=n%10
#though the use of a while loop the program is able to take each single digit fro it overall number through modulus
 #here we have to calculate the numbers length which is within vaiarabe length to see if its an armstrong number.   
#also this will find 
        Armtotal=Armtotal+(A**length)
#each one of the digits for the number will be taken and then cubbed with p and then addd to the varaible ArmTotal
        n=int(n/10)
#here is where the original number is compared with the current number thats been adding up together and stored within the armtotal varaible.
    #if the programs sees that these are the same it will true while if not will be put down as false
    if WhNumber==Armtotal:
        return True
    else:
        return False
#here this is outsde all of this program and is where the users input is put into the code
#here they will put there number in that tey want to check if armstrong and the functo wil be called back tobe used again.
Armstrong=input("please enter your number right over here: ")
if ThisisMyArmstrong(Armstrong):
    print(Armstrong, "is in fact a armstrong number!!!!whoopy!!!")
else:
    print (Armstrong, "is in fact ****not**** a form of armstrong number. :(")
