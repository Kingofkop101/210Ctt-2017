////Write the pseudocode and code for a function that determines whether an array is a
palindrome (reads the same in both directions). What is the time complexity (expressed using
BigO notation)?

#here the true statement will be displayed to all
        return True
    
#otherwise it will be false if the start of the array and the end of the array is the end
