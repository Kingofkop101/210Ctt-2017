/////
Write a program that reads n words from the standard input, separated by spaces and prints
them mirrored (the mirroring function should be implemented recursively). What is the time
complexity of the algorithm? Use the BigO notation to express it.

#here is the function that i have created called MirrorTheNmbers and will be called later on in order to give us a output to wha we are looking for
#one parameter will also be passed for this function and ive named it Nwords.
def MirrorTheNumbers(Nwords):
#here i have used a vairable which is going to be the Wrdlength and the index of this function
#so here we have stored the length of the string within the variable

     WrdLength=len(Nwords)-1
#this here EndResult s going t be the output for this program and this will be where the string of what ever is unputted will be kept.
     EndResult=""
#here i have us3ed a while loop with brackets stating that if the WrdLength is eqal too or gretaer then zero the loop will contnuously repeat.
     
     while(WrdLength>=0):
#here is where the individual characters will be added from end to the begining or 1st
         EndResult += Nwords[WrdLength]

         WrdLength-=1

     return EndResult
